### Hi there 👋, I'm Tobi
#### Computer Vision - Machine Learning - Systems Engineering
![Computer Vision - Machine Learning - Systems Engineering](https://github.com/TobiasWeis/TobiasWeis/blob/main/banner.jpg?raw=true)

I have a PhD in Computerscience in the fields of Machine Learning, Cognitive Systems and Systems Engineering.
My public github consists only of private fun-projects, as most of my professional work has happened under NDAs. 
More details about my career and projects can be found on my personal website: www.tobias-weis.de

I love crunching and visualizing data for ML and AI, building robots and tinkering with electronics of all sorts, and creating full-stack applications.
I recently stepped up my project-management-game by completing the specialization by Google, and am taking MBA-courses from the University of Illinois.

Skills: AI / ML / Computer Vision / Python / Java / C(++) / JS / REACT
